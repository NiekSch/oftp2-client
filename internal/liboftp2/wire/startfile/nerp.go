   NERPREAS  Reason code                                      Numeric(2)

             This attribute will specify why transmission cannot proceed
             or why processing of the file failed.

   NERPREASL Reason Text Length                              Numeric(3)

             Length in octets of the field NERPREAST.

             0 indicates that no NERPREAST field follows.

   NERPREAST Reason Text                                     [UTF-8](n)

             Reason why transmission cannot proceed in plain text.

             It is encoded using [UTF-8].

             Maximum length of the encoded reason is 999 octets.

             No general structure is defined for this attribute.

   NERPHSHL  Virtual File hash length                          Binary(2)

             Length in octets of the field NERPHSH.

             A binary value of 0 indicates that no hash is present.
             This is always the case if the NERP is not signed.

   NERPHSH   Virtual File hash                                 Binary(n)

             Hash of the Virtual File being transmitted.

             The algorithm used is determined by the bilaterally agreed
             cipher suite specified in the SFIDCIPH.

   NERPSIGL  NERP Signature length                             Binary(2)

             0 indicates that this NERP has not been signed.

             Any other value indicates the length of NERPSIG in octets
             and indicates that this NERP has been signed.

   NERPSIG   NERP Signature                                    Binary(n)

             Contains the [CMS] enveloped signature of the NERP.

             Signature = Sign{NERPDSN
                              NERPDATE
                              NERPTIME
                              NERPDEST
                              NERPORIG
                              NERPCREA
                              NERPHSH}

             Each field is taken in its entirety, including any padding.
             The envelope must contain the original data, not just the
             signature.

             The [CMS] content type used is SignedData.

             The encapsulated content type used is id-data.

             It is an application issue to validate the signature with
             the contents of the NERP.
